## What do we want to be and what do we want to achieve?

| **Target Operating Model Vision** |

Defining the vision for your organization, the services it will provide and the capabilities needed to deliver these, shaping how all other dimensions of the operating model need to be designed and the priority in which they need to be addressed. Defining from the outset a clear vision, mission & set of principles is critical as it sets the direction, tone and shape of all other operating dimensions.

## Constructing a vision, mission and principles 

| **Target Operating Model Vision** |

The two top layers of the detail are the ways in which vision and mission statements align to clients overarching strategy. **Vision** describes what we aspire to achieve e.g. Creating the very best digital products, enabled by flexible platforms and the best talent. **Mission** describles what we do and who we do it for.

These mission statements are subsequently met through key **transformation levers** which describe how the vision and mission be achieved.

The foundational layer introduces the key **principles** that guide the direction of transformation and underpin the way in which digital products are created and cloud is adopted within IT and adopted across the enterprise.

### Guiding Principles

<br>

The guiding principles set the direction and guardrails for operating model transformation. A strong principle is supported by a clear rationale and associated implications.

A Guiding Principle is a high level statement of intent or purpose intended to guide and govern the design & operation of the operating model. The Rationale highlights the business benefits of adopting the principle. These are directly related to the mission statements. Implications are tasks that must happen in order to successfully implement the principle to realise the associated benefits.

Here is a set of principles that are emerging in transformative enterprises:

1. **Business Oriented** - In everything we do, have what we are trying to achieve as a business and what delivers value at heart.
2. **Innovation** - Constantly innovate in the products we create, the way we work, looking for inspiration in how we can transform our business by embracing the latest technology.
3. **Agile culture** - Create an agile culture where everyone is looking to deliver value through every action we take and making that available to others.
4. **Developer First** - Put the developer experience at the forefront of what we do and enable them to create business value and digital products that delight our customers.
5. **Self-Service** - Create products and platforms that can be easy accessed, understood and consumed, in a self-service way wherever possible.
6. **Sharing** - Share for the benefit of your colleagues, teams and the enterprise through assets, practices, experiences, skills and support.

Principles will have an impact on the design and elaboration across a range of operating model dimensions, such as the 2nd example above i.e. Innovation.

* **Principle**
    - Constantly innovate in the products we create, the way we work, looking for inspiration in how we can transform our business by embracing the latest technology.
* **Rationale**
    -    Our industry is underthreat from new start-up market entrants and therefore we need to make sure we innovate what we do to ensure we are constantly providing the best customer experience.
    -    We need to transform the way we think and work as an organistion to ensure we are always improving what we do to be more effective and efficient, focusing on what adds value.
* **Implications**
    -    **Ways of Working**: Provide Design Thinking and User Journey training to everyone in the organisation
    -    **Workforce Model**: Allow headroom to our colleague to tackle ‘pet projects’
    -    **Financial Model**: Provide funding for ‘sandpitting’ of new technology to every employee
    -    **Processes**: Create a mechanism to showcase potential initiatives to receive innovation funding
    -    **Leadership & Culture**: Develop a culture where people are encouraged to think differently and beyond the everyday
    -    **Partnering & Sourcing**: Establish a regular forum for our partners to showcase their latest thinking and technology
    -    **Financial Model**: Provide funding for colleauges to attend conferences and technology showcases
    -    **Governance**: Develop and innovation forum as part of our governance structure 
    -    **Locations & Facilities**: Create innovation spaces where people can collaborate outside of normal teams

### How Vision, Mission & Goals effect the organizations in the enterprise

Over the course of the operating model transformation, each area of the organisation may elaborate their own set of principles in-line with the overall vision & mission.
