## What services does the next generation IT organisation offer?
The service portfolio outlines what is offered, developed and supported across the organisation using a common taxonomy, language and service definition. It covers all products and services across the organisation in a clear and transparent way.

Why is it important?
-    Provides clarity on what products and services are offered, develop and managed within the organisation and by suppliers, with identified internal product owners
-    Clearly defines the role between and application and platform engineering teams and establishes clear ownership
-    Creates clear line of sight between business services and underlying technology simplifying supportability and operations
-    Helps avoid duplication of functionality and accelerates development through patterns that are architected and built with the necessary security and compliance approval
-    Make services more consumable by describing them in a common way, make costs transparent, presenting in a curated catalogue and automating access and provisioning where possible
-    Helps manage the lifecycle of services driving investment decisions, architectural choices and service strategy

## Key principles for establishing Service Porfolios

| Principle                   | Description       |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Single & Hybrid Offering    | - The same offering must be delivered everywhere.<BR>- Leverage capabilities from Private and Public Cloud Providers and facilitate Exit Strategies.                  |
| Technology Agnostic         | - Focus on the abstraction and the interface defined by the service and the value which gets delivered rather than particular implementations that might be supporting it.                                                                              |
| Standardized & Prescriptive | - Consumer applications and services rely on the set of standardized set of Cloud Platform Services that have been published for each customer.<BR>- Each service might require a number of other mandatory service components (either by policy or as part of a bundle) in order to meet other key objectives and requirements.                |
| Managed & Platform-centric  | - As opposed to Workload centric offering, a Platform-centric offering provides Cloud Services that presents building blocks that can be used by consumer applications and services.<BR>- A managed Cloud Service Portfolio must ensure and deliver:<BR> - Value that contributes to fulfill the vision and the strategy<BR> - Enterprise grade SLAs. |
| Differentiated              | - A Single, Managed, Secure and Hybrid Multicloud offering presents a distinctive value chain that goes way beyond the one obtained by just doing a pass-through of technology proposals from different CSPs.                                           |
| Compelling & Competitive    | - The Service Offering must be compelling and competitive so that customers are willing to adopt it<BR> - The CCC must make sure the solution proposed as a Service Offering is cost effective and cost efficient.                                          |
| Agile                       | - The Service Definition process must follow a regular cadence of small, frequent and incremental iterations.<BR> - Prioritization efforts must take into consideration a positive feedback loop with customers and prospects.|
