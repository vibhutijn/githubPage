## Data Virtualization

- One of the primary problems that clients face is how to provide a "unified view of data" across regions. 
- Most of the companies have grown as a result of acquisitions of regional companies that in many cases operate independently and maintain their local IT infrastructure. There are data model mismatches, different levels of granularity when representing the same entity, and different interfaces and protocols to access the same kind of information, making difficult to achieve a unified view of data.
- To solve these issues, _data virtualization_ provides an abstraction layer that keeps a unified and common representation of the business entities, in the form of a Canonical Business Model that can be consumed by all the enterprise applications regardless of the underlying data schemas in every location.
- It helps customers capture data from multiple data sources and allows them to be treated as a single source, delivering the right data in the required form and at the right time to any application and/or user, in real time.
- The benefits of data virtualization for companies include quickly combining different sources of data, improving productivity, accelerating time value, eliminating latency, maintaining data warehouse, and reducing the need for multiple copies of data as well as less hardware.
