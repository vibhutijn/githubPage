# Hybrid / Multicloud Application Integration


Application integrations are key to streamlining enterprises business processes and enabling data movement across systems. 

As part of digital transformation initiatives, enterprises are adopting cloud computing to take advantage of the optimization and flexibility the cloud platforms and providers bring to the table. Application workloads are moving to cloud platforms. This will often result in a hybrid cloud target state for enterprises. Public clouds (such as those from IBM, AWS, Azure or Google), SaaS solutions, private clouds, in-house container platforms and traditional data centers are all part of this mix. 

A hybrid cloud target introduces the following new integration patterns:

 1. Intra cloud - Integrations between applications in the same cloud platform.
 2. Inter cloud -  Integration between applications deployed in different cloud platforms as well as applications in cloud and SaaS solutions.
 3. Cloud to on-premises - Integration between core Systems of Records (SOR) that are on-premise, and application deployed on a Cloud through integrations platforms like an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).

We are majorly focused here for point-2 and point-3 in this scenario:

There are few considerations for Application integration distributed across various cloud providers or on-premise or on-private clouds:

 1. Enterprise Integration landscape has evolved from Point-to-point  to Enterprise Application integration(EAI)  middleware  to Service-oriented-Architecture(SOA). The Fact is major enterprise is using Enterprise service bus , enterprise Messaging queuing  or File based solution  for solving integration problems . Their integration Landscape should be ready to talk with Hybrid/Multi cloud platform, applications or data.
 2. Need a transformation of Integration landscape for cloud readiness and able to fulfill cloud related requirements agility , scalability and resiliency.
 3. Need cloud application connectors to enable connectivity with different SaaS applications . 
 4. Need the capability to connect between Cloud and On-premise/ground  applications . 
 5. Simplify exposing business functionalities/data using REST APIs. 
 6. Support all the integration patterns as APIs , Events  and File based and support interaction/integrations with cloud messaging middleware and API Gateway solution. 
 7. Hybrid/Multi Cloud have their own security solution for authentication and authorization. How to integrate these security solutions for authentication and authorization? 
 8. Support distributed and decentralized integration solution to full fill Hybrid /Multi Cloud targets.
