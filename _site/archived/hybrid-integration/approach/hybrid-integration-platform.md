## What is a hybrid integration platform?

[According to Ovum](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/in-en/signup?formid=urx-39103){:target="_blank"}, a hybrid integration platform is “*a cohesive set of integration software (middleware) products enabling users to develop, secure and govern integration flows connecting diverse applications, systems, services and data stores, as well as enabling rapid API creation/composition and lifecycle management to meet the requirements of a range of hybrid integration use cases*.”

In other words, a hybrid integration platform should provide organizations with all of the tools they need to make it simpler and easier to integrate data and applications across any on-premises and multicloud environment. With data silos broken down, businesses have an incredible opportunity to turn their data into actionable insights, allowing them to make better decisions faster.   

Hybrid Integration Platform should also provide the below form factors:

 - **Increase efficiency**: The platform is low-code to employs to drive speed in integration development. In support of agile DevOps, the platform provides tools for test-driven development and automated continuous integration, continuous delivery (CICD) pipelines.
 
 - **Provide flexibility**: A distributed component-based architecture supports lightweight fine-grained integration services to enable microservices and on-demand runtime application-level composition and aggregation. You can build on open standards for quick innovation and assured compatibility across a diverse environment.
 
 - **Make the most of your investments**: It should provide support for integration in an architecture that is built on different cloud services from different cloud vendors and technologies and across many cloud deployment models, including public, private, and SaaS. It should also support for traditional integration styles and the ability to experiment with a containerized approach.

## What are the key capabilities to look for in a hybrid integration platform?

Today’s integration teams need access to a mix of tools that allow them to balance traditional and modern integration styles. When evaluating hybrid integration platforms, here are the most important capabilities you should look to evaluate.

 1. **API lifecycle management.** APIs are among the most common styles of modern integration. Companies need to be able to create, secure, manage and share APIs across environments quickly and easily. 
 2. **Application and data integration.** Siloed data is one of the most critical problems organizations face when trying to digitally transform. The ability to copy and synchronize data across applications will help address a variety of issues, including data formats and standards.
 3. **Messaging and event-driven architecture.** Syncing and standardizing data is crucial, but if enterprises want to be able to build more engaging customer experiences or react to things in real-time, they need to have the ability to securely exchange that data across their ecosystem from any cloud-based to on-premise application. 
 4. **High-speed data transfer.** The sheer volume of data being exchanged in a modern environment can be staggering. In fact, by 2025, [IDC predicts](https://resources.moredirect.com/storage-optimization/idc-report-the-digitization-of-the-world-from-edge-to-core){:target="_blank"} worldwide data creation will reach 163 zettabytes per year. That’s ten times as much data as the world produced in 2017.

Until recently, hybrid integration platforms were mostly thought of as something that organizations needed to build by piecing together key capabilities from existing tools (like API management software, iPaaS and ESB solutions) from a variety of vendors into a cohesive system. This can be an expensive and cumbersome process. 

Instead, enterprises should consider complete solutions, like [IBM Cloud Pak for Integration](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-integration){:target="_blank"}, which combine all of the capabilities required for both traditional and modern integration styles into a unified, containerized platform. Features like single sign-on, common logging, tracing, an asset repository and a unified dashboard help bring all of the capabilities together and make integration workflows more efficient.
