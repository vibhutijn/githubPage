<p>When an event driven integration approach is followed, there could be lot of unwanted events being raised.</p>

<p>This pattern helps to reduce this noise and process only relevant events by applying transformation and filtering rules and caching processed events.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Filtering and transformation rules are used to:
    <ul>
      <li>Drop irrelevant events (i.e. CDC might send everything)</li>
      <li>Set event destination</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Event cache is used to:
    <ul>
      <li>Filter out duplicate events</li>
      <li>Aggregate low-level events</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Transformation engine is used to:
    <ul>
      <li>Apply event transformation logic</li>
      <li>Applying data transformation rules, splitting complex events and aggregating low level events</li>
      <li>Defines destination for transformed events</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
