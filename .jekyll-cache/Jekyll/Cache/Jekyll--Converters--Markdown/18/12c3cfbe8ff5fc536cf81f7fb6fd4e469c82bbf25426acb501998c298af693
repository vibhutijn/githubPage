<p>How you operate contributes more to the ability to innovate and being agile for an enterprise than any technology you can adopt as an enterprise. Operating Models for Future Application Development are about locking in the value of your investments in cloud and exploiting them for growth. Cloud is more than a set of technologies, therefore successfully adopting and operating multicloud requires operating model transformation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Competitive disruption is driving new and changed business models enabled by technology that IT is asked to integrate, secure, and operate.</li>
  <li>IT‚Äôs mission has been redefined to become a digital integrator across multiple business and IT platforms - a mission that requires a multicloud operating model.</li>
  <li>Cloud technology cannot be separated from the organisational, cultural, and process transformation needed to use those technologies to drive desired business outcomes.</li>
</ul>

<p>To capture the value of these investments, enterprises need to change how they operate with clients, employees, partners, and regulatory authorities to provide digital products in a safe, sustainable, consistent, quality and profitable fashion. Our Cloud Strategy Operating model examines how to look at the changes you will need to make in organizing for and executing new work to deliver Digital Products and Services in a much changed operating environment. Each operating model dimension must be aligned with multicloud. A multicloud target operating model is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Powered by cloud platforms that are full-stack operated with clear governance and a powerful IT ecosystem</li>
  <li>Supported by skilled people, collaborative enterprise culture, and automated processes.</li>
</ul>

    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><img src="../resources/tom-vision.png" alt="TOM Vision" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Defining the vision for your organization, the services it will provide and the capabilities needed to deliver these, shaping how all other dimensions of the operating model need to be designed and the priority in which they need to be addressed. Defining from the outset a clear vision, mission &amp; set of principles is critical as it sets the direction, tone and shape of all other operating dimensions.</p>

<h2 id="constructing-a-vision-mission-and-principles">Constructing a Vision, Mission and Principles</h2>

<table>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The two top layers of the detail are the ways in which vision and mission statements align to clients overarching strategy. <strong>Vision</strong> describes what we aspire to achieve e.g. Creating the very best digital products, enabled by flexible platforms and the best talent. <strong>Mission</strong> describles what we do and who we do it for.</p>

<p>These mission statements are subsequently met through key <strong>transformation levers</strong> which describe how the vision and mission be achieved.</p>

<p>The foundational layer introduces the key <strong>principles</strong> that guide the direction of transformation and underpin the way in which digital products are created and cloud is adopted within IT and adopted across the enterprise.</p>

<h2 id="guiding-principles">Guiding Principles</h2>

<p>The guiding principles set the direction and guardrails for operating model transformation. A strong principle is supported by a clear rationale and associated implications.</p>

<table>
  <thead>

    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><img src="../resources/tom-principles.png" alt="TOM Principles" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>A Guiding Principle is a high level statement of intent or purpose intended to guide and govern the design &amp; operation of the operating model. The Rationale highlights the business benefits of adopting the principle. These are directly related to the mission statements. Implications are tasks that must happen in order to successfully implement the principle to realise the associated benefits.</p>

<p>Here is a set of principles that are emerging in transformative enterprises:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Business Oriented</strong> - In everything we do, have what we are trying to achieve as a business and what delivers value at heart.</li>
  <li><strong>Innovation</strong> - Constantly innovate in the products we create, the way we work, looking for inspiration in how we can transform our business by embracing the latest technology.</li>
  <li><strong>Agile culture</strong> - Create an agile culture where everyone is looking to deliver value through every action we take and making that available to others.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer First</strong> - Put the developer experience at the forefront of what we do and enable them to create business value and digital products that delight our customers.</li>
  <li><strong>Self-Service</strong> - Create products and platforms that can be easy accessed, understood and consumed, in a self-service way wherever possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Sharing</strong> - Share for the benefit of your colleagues, teams and the enterprise through assets, practices, experiences, skills and support.</li>
</ol>

<p>Principles will have an impact on the design and elaboration across a range of operating model dimensions, such as the 2nd example above i.e. Innovation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Principle</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Constantly innovate in the products we create, the way we work, looking for inspiration in how we can transform our business by embracing the latest technology.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Rationale</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Our industry is underthreat from new start-up market entrants and therefore we need to make sure we innovate what we do to ensure we are constantly providing the best customer experience.</li>
      <li>We need to transform the way we think and work as an organistion to ensure we are always improving what we do to be more effective and efficient, focusing on what adds value.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Implications</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ways of Working</strong>: Provide Design Thinking and User Journey training to everyone in the organisation</li>
      <li><strong>Workforce Model</strong>: Allow headroom to our colleague to tackle ‚Äòpet projects‚Äô</li>
      <li><strong>Financial Model</strong>: Provide funding for ‚Äòsandpitting‚Äô of new technology to every employee</li>
      <li><strong>Processes</strong>: Create a mechanism to showcase potential initiatives to receive innovation funding</li>
      <li><strong>Leadership &amp; Culture</strong>: Develop a culture where people are encouraged to think differently and beyond the everyday</li>
      <li><strong>Partnering &amp; Sourcing</strong>: Establish a regular forum for our partners to showcase their latest thinking and technology</li>
      <li><strong>Financial Model</strong>: Provide funding for colleauges to attend conferences and technology showcases</li>
      <li><strong>Governance</strong>: Develop and innovation forum as part of our governance structure</li>
      <li><strong>Locations &amp; Facilities</strong>: Create innovation spaces where people can collaborate outside of normal teams</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-capabilities-are-required-to-deliver-digital-products--pervices-and-platform-services">What Capabilities Are Required to Deliver Digital Products &amp; Pervices and Platform Services?</h2>

<p>A broad range of capabilities are required to ideate, develop, support and control digital products and services throughout their lifecycle.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Engagement &amp; Demand</strong>: the capabilities needed to translate business strategy, needs and requests into products and platforms and ensure the right skills are available across the organisation.</li>
  <li><strong>Product Lifecycle Management</strong>: the capabilities needed to architect, develop and release both application and platform/technology products and services.</li>
  <li><strong>Fulfillment &amp; Provisioning</strong>: the capabilities required to make products and services easily consumable and rapidly available for use when needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Service Operations</strong>: the capabilities required to support and operate products and services and ensure they are performant, resilient and meet business and user service levels.</li>
  <li><strong>Governance &amp; Control</strong>: the capabilities required to support and operate products and services, and ensure they are performant, resilient and meet business and user service levels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of these capabilities cut across the organisation, but have a ‚Äòcentre of gravity‚Äô of where the direction and approach for these is set.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many of these capabilities will be required across various areas of the organisation and will play a role in developing and supporting digital products in an effective, flexible and agile way.</li>
  <li>However, there is typically a ‚Äòcentre of gravity‚Äô within the organization that helps set the direction, standards and process for how that should be done across the organisation.</li>
  <li>Where this ‚Äòcentre of gravity‚Äô resides can vary depending on the maturity of the organisation and the level of autonomy in which parts of the organisation are given.</li>

  <li>How do I create a platform architecture to enable developers and business users to create business value?</li>
  <li>How do I best utilise and access an ecosystem of partners to add value to what we do?</li>
  <li>How has the recent pandemic changed traditional location-based working?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="digital-platforms">Digital Platforms</h2>

<p>Leading digital organisations are creating scalable, flexible and multi-level platforms that can be easily consumed by developers, business users and partners:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Business Platforms - Developing business platforms and services that can be re-used within the rest of the organisation (both business users and development teams) and with partners and B2B customers</li>
  <li>Technology Platforms - Creating platforms on-top of cloud services that embed automation, controls and security that are easily consumable by developers ‚Äòas code‚Äô or via a self-service portal via a single pane of glass</li>
</ol>

<p>The key drivers for such platforms are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Engineered with open interfaces,¬†‚Äôstandard‚Äô¬†based and easy to connect to</li>
  <li>Are aligned and pre-built to architectural, service, compliance and security standards</li>
  <li>Removes a level of operations that needs to be performed by developers so they can focus on adding value and creating digital products</li>
  <li>Adds value on-top of ‚Äòout-of-the-box‚Äô cloud and technology services</li>
  <li>Provides a set¬†of stable core components, but which can support variety and evolution</li>
  <li>Easily extensible, enabling scalability, not just on demand but based on strategy¬†</li>
  <li>Encourages and facilitates innovation and novel usage</li>
  <li>Opens up a business capability to be accessed by partners and customers</li>
  <li>Allows the rest of the organisation and partners to add value and capture value through the interfaces</li>
</ul>

<p>Business platforms are built upon a foundation of technology platforms, connected in an open and transparent way</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each platform provides a range of services that can be easily publish and consumed to construct digital products and services</li>
  <li>These are surfaced either via APIs, CLI, self-service catalogues or through other user interfaces and visualisation engines (i.e. codeless BPM)</li>
  <li>These can be combined together via open API and connectors</li>
  <li>Each platform service should also provide APIs to monitor and operate services to provide visibility of availability and performance</li>

<p>The process off managing interactions with cloud providers (platform vendors, SaaS providers, service vendors) formally by selecting them based on their ability to meet identified requirements and managing performance against the agreed upon commitments within the Service Catalogue.</p>

<p>Some of the  key focus areas in this function include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Migrating to as-a-service commercial models for both technology infrastructure enabled by cloud computing and a flexible workforce that delivers outcome-driven engagements</li>
  <li>Adopting a more liquid workforce as they try to bridge the skill gaps resulting from rapid changes in technology</li>
  <li>Implement the right mix of local and global focus given the flexibility on cloud, new ways of working and need for shorter delivery cycles with high business involvement</li>

<ol>
  <li>Collaborative Sourcing Relationships - Shift away from focus on deliverables and service levels. Focus on a sourcing philosophy to embrace a partnership approach that can result in collaborative processes, skill development</li>
  <li>Managed Capacity - As enterprises continuously evolve their strategies and roadmap, they would need to pull in capabilities and services on Demand</li>
  <li>Open collaboration tooling - The new ways of working would need collaborative working practices across microsites. Supplier base model will need to adjust to match the DevOps Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Service Brokerage and Orchestration - Provide a centralized catalog of internal and external cloud, business platform and Open APIs to fuel rapid innovation across the enterprise</li>
  <li>Multisourcing Strategies - Unlike the conventional tower-based sourcing, Continuous Delivery in a cloud world require flexible sourcing strategies that allow multiple vendors collaborate with clearly defined roes</li>
  <li>Opex Centric Consumption driven planning - The IT service framework now prices IT Services incrementally from the IT vendors to get accurate Operational Expense forecasting.  Consumption driven planning with Business Product Owners</li>
  <li>Predictive Demand Planning - Use in-depth analysis and predictive forecasts to anticipate demand and initiate sourcing with sufficient lead times</li>
  <li>Monitoring - Globally monitor and control all local / regional cloud service consumption for continuous platform optimisation. Drive usage analytics and chargebacks through automated single unified plane of control across cloud service providers</li>
  <li>Mitigation - Managing Cloud Platform risks like Vendor-lock-in, latency, security, and availability as an integral part of the Sourcing Strategy</li>

<h2 id="dynamic-delivery">Dynamic Delivery</h2>

<p>Pre-pandemic, delivery models were optimised with delivery across client site, nearshore and offshore delivery centres. To balance cost and value, enterprises had Co-located garages for experience and innovation complimented by distributed Agile practices.</p>

<p>With the pandemic, this was challenges as business continuity came to the fore. Enterprises had to deal with Dispersed teams &amp; Individual silos, lack of certainty and change in priority of projects as well as security concerns - truly hindering innovation.</p>

<h3 id="shift-1">Shift 1</h3>

<p>Enterprises initially focussed on recovering from this situation and getting back into being a resilient organization. This shift was focused on Employee safety, making existing team members virtually equidistant, bringing certainty to Program delivery, increasing portability of tasks and restoring Innovation.</p>

<p>This shifted focus on 100% Cloudified Delivery Methods by adopting to Virtual Garage models and updated Security procedures and getting their teams skilled in virtual execution.</p>

<h3 id="shift-2">Shift 2</h3>

<p>Having realized the longetivity of the situation and the ability to change, enterprises are evolving further to generate value in spite of the handicap. Delivery across sites and individuals are being optimized for skill and cost (hybrid and variable), Automation has been taken up a notch in the Cloudified Delivery Platforms.</p>

<p>How can I measure performance within my organisation in a way that proactively informs future decision-making while offering line of sight into accountability and decision ownership?</p>

<p>Metrics and KPIs need to change from retrospectively assessing performance to proactively driving action. Historically, performance metrics and KPIs were static measures that looked backward to assess progress and lacked traceability to an organisation‚Äôs strategic objectives.</p>

<p>However, performance metrics must evolve to meet the demands of today‚Äôs modern IT estate. Instead of measuring past activity, metrics should be designed and implemented in a way that helps drive the organisation‚Äôs overall objectives and appropriate action, where possible, in a pre-emptive or predictive fashion. To do so, leading practice suggests organisations should use the industry recognised OKR (Objective &amp; Key Results) approach for measuring and improving performance.</p>

<h3 id="okr">OKR</h3>

<p>OKR is an Effective Methodology for Measuring  Performance, OKR, known as Objective and Key Results, is a methodology is a system for setting, cascading and communicating goals throughout your organization. OKRs bring focus because they make it easy for companies, departments, and teams to recognize what the current priorities are, and to align them to employees personal objectives.</p>

<p>Benefits of an OKR:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Focus: OKR creates clarity and focus. Everyone has fewer defined objectives, which forces prioritisation at all levels.</li>
  <li>Fast paced: OKRs are short term goals‚Äîtypically 3 months in length. This gives employees more chances to assess and improve work.</li>
  <li>Better results: using short term goals creates a culture where problems are solved quickly and where every contribution matters. This results in better and more consistent results</li>
</ul>

<p>An OKR consists of two things:</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong> - memorable qualitative description of what you want to achieve. Objectives should be short, inspirational and engaging. Objectives should motivate and challenge the team.</p>

<p><strong>Key Results</strong> - set of metrics that measure progress towards objective. They should not be a task. Each objective has 2-5 key results.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>For example,   
Objective #1: We will improve release velocity of the sprint Q3-2019 for version X.Y of product B as measured by ‚Ä¶.

Key Results:
-    Reduce bugs found during development process by 20%
-    Improve Unit testing coverage from 50% to 70%
-    increase sprint capacity from 85 item (Sprint Planning ) to 100 SP
-    Individual developer contributes to 20% more code review by end of every sprint
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>OKRs will vary across the organisation based on their priorities mapping reference OKRs to each CSOM component, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Center of Excellence Sample Objective: Drive adoption and usage of cloud services in consistent way; Sample Key Results: Enhanced skills on cloud technologies, Increased brand perception by customers</li>
  <li>Platform Engineering &amp; Operations Sample Objective: Incubate new technology platforms; Sample Key Results: Faster time to provision infrastructure, Increased Automation with DevSecOps toolchain enabled</li>
  <li>Integrated Service Management Sample Objective: Protect live service; Sample Key Results: Increase Process Efficiency, Proactively monitor services, Provide real-time reporting on service performance</li>
  <li>Application Engineering &amp; Operations Sample Objective: Accelerate the development team speed; Sample Key Results: Reduced time to delivery, Change, release, incident and problem tightly coupled</li>
</ul>
