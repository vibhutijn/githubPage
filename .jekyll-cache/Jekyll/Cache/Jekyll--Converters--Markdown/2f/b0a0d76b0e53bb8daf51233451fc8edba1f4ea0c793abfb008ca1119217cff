<h2 id="what-capabilities-are-required-to-deliver-digital-products--services-and-platform-services">What capabilities are required to deliver digital products &amp; services and platform services?</h2>

<p>A broad range of capabilities are required to ideate, develop, support and control digital products and services throughout their lifecycle.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Engagement &amp; Demand</strong>: the capabilities needed to translate business strategy, needs and requests into products and platforms and ensure the right skills are available across the organisation.</li>
  <li><strong>Product Lifecycle Management</strong>: the capabilities needed to architect, develop and release both application and platform/technology products and services.</li>
  <li><strong>Fulfillment &amp; Provisioning</strong>: the capabilities required to make products and services easily consumable and rapidly available for use when needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Service Operations</strong>: the capabilities required to support and operate products and services and ensure they are performant, resilient and meet business and user service levels.</li>
  <li><strong>Governance &amp; Control</strong>: the capabilities required to support and operate products and services, and ensure they are performant, resilient and meet business and user service levels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of these capabilities cut across the organisation, but have a ‚Äòcentre of gravity‚Äô of where the direction and approach for these is set.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many of these capabilities will be required across various areas of the organisation and will play a role in developing and supporting digital products in an effective, flexible and agile way.</li>
  <li>However, there is typically a ‚Äòcentre of gravity‚Äô within the organization that helps set the direction, standards and process for how that should be done across the organisation.</li>
  <li>Where this ‚Äòcentre of gravity‚Äô resides can vary depending on the maturity of the organisation and the level of autonomy in which parts of the organisation are given.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="capability-evolution">Capability Evolution</h2>

<p>The key question to ask is how these capabilities are changing for leading digital, platform and cloud enabled organisations? Some capabilities are reinventing themselves and some new capabilities are found to be necessary for optimization that is happening in the operating model of digital enterprises.</p>
