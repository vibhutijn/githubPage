# Automating Non-cloud Environment

## What is it & why do it?
While enterprises are still transitioning from traditional to cloud infrastructure and adopting more & more cloud-native technology & practices, they still own and operate infrastructure which is neither ready for not compatible with much of these modern cloud-native technologies and practices.

More importantly, there is a lot of inefficiencies in how these systems are operated when seen with a contemporary lens locking up huge opportunities and being able to unlock that cost-benefit in any manner - even if not in its entirety leads to big contributions to the overall Cloud adoption ROI.

### Examples

***Need examples where for lack of automation, traditional environments are costing time and money***

### Benefits

-	Infrastructure utilization optimization
-	Reduced cost of non-reliable systems
-	Allows agility for the system
-	Allows agility for dependent cloud initiatives

## IBM Approach
Ansible & other automation technology based solutions.
