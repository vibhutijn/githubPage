# External Integration with REST APIs and Building API-Economy

<br>

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk each other. With the help of APIs, digital experience is growing very fast, such as booking a hotel room, booking rental car, downloading software, etc. 

REST APIs are the access standard for new application projects and enablement of digital business. As adoption and demand for REST APIs proliferated, there was a significant recognition across enterprises that REST APIs and API Management have a important role in integration. These business REST APIs also helps to create new revenue channels for businesses.

Please find below the following requirements for APIs based integrations:

 1. Need to provide the APIs documentation (details of the functionality offered by APIs)    
 2. Have a dependency on the performance and availability of the API  
 3. API Lifecycle management and version control  
 4. API Usage Controls (rate limiting / traffic controls) 
 5. Appropriate security controls (who can use what ?) & specialized security features for encryption/decryption, redaction, etc. 
 6. Easy discovery of APIs for consumers

**Business Benefits of an API Driven Strategy**
 - Reduced Costs and time to Market: One of the main benefits of an API-driven strategy is a reduction in development effort and faster time to market. Embracing and leveraging APIs helps businesses save money and resources and focus on other unique functionalities to deliver for applications/solution. 
 
 - Superior Digital Experience: APIs will be consumed to build solutions across any channel, this creates better and more engaging experiences for any audience, whether that be for customers, partners or your employees. APIs can help to enable the delivery of services such as personalization, data collection and integration. 
 
 - Enablement of New Technologies: Modern application architecture of cloud services, IoT devices and new technologies rely on APIs. According to an article by [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-road-to-the-api-economy/){:target="_blank"}, “APIs are now central to application architecture because they enable loosely coupled integration, as well as being the data conduits behind mobile apps and many IoT devices.” This also can empower internal innovation by providing the agility and flexibility needed to do so.

With integration modernization to cater the need of distributed API provider/backend on public / private or cloud providers, there has been shift from SOA exposure (single gateway) to distributed and decentralized API exposure.
