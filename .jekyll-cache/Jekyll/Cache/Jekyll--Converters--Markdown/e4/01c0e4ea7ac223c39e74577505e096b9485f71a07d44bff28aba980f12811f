<h2 id="what-is-low-code-no-code">What is Low-Code No-Code</h2>

<p>Visual software deployment platform for creating business applications with a click or drag and drop of components and piecing them together. Key benefits of Low-Code No-Code development platforms are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quickly create and deploy applications</li>
  <li>Improved business process agility and automation</li>
  <li>Standard design and accessibility principles</li>
  <li>Easy to build and test</li>
  <li>A simple submission(data) transformed into end-end service</li>
  <li>No complex deployments, hosting, integrations required</li>
  <li>Business perspective development platforms</li>
  <li>Frontend, backend, data, process flows, and architecture all embedded into the platform</li>
  <li>
    <p>Provides holistic view of the entire applications</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Model components</strong> should be immutable,any new changes should be new components, extensive testing is required, need support for flexible auth requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid vendor lock-in</strong> by using open source-based components, no frequent updates to components, cultural changes and training needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Set appropriate security constraints</strong> for B2E, B2C and B2B applications, customization is difficult, data compliance policies revisit needed.</li>
</ul>
