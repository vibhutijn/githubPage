<p>Organizations are being disrupted from traditional competitors and new players never seen in their markets. To combat the disruption, organization recognize they need to pivot, act quickly to market shifts, create new markets and lower the cost of operations to compete. A key element in an organization’s transformation strategy is technology. Leveraging emerging technologies can often be the difference between being disrupted or being the disruptor.  Today’s top organizations are leveraging emerging technology to innovate and differentiate. Key to their success is the ability to reimagine existing customer facing applications and build new applications that support new ways of delivering goods and services. Central to their digital transformation journey is Application Development.</p>
