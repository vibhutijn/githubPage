## IBM Approach

### Evolve to Agile Integration

Agile integration is an approach that breaks a centralized monolithic integration component, such as an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), into smaller fine-grained independent components. Those smaller components can be dropped into the architecture seamlessly and removed or updated without disrupting other components. 

Agile integration is “a container-based, decentralized and microservices-aligned architecture for integration solutions.”

### Rethink Ownership

As the number of digital channels grows and the variety in their back-end service consumption increases, the ownership of the integration layer becomes less centralized and shifts to the application layer.

### Access Fine-grained Data via APIs

Tailor the data you expose to external third-party developers, to business partners, and to internal departments within your company. Developers can readily use standard APIs to build their own business objects.

### Scale with Lightweight Integration Runtimes

With the advent of virtual machines, containers, and container orchestration, you can break the centralized ESB pattern into smaller, more easily managed independent pieces.

Agile integration is defined as “a container- based, decentralized and microservices- aligned architecture for integration solutions.”
