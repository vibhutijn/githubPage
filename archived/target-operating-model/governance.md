## Overview

The modern Cloud Strategy Operating Model Governance model ensures that all four of its IT elements (i.e. Cloud Centre of Excellence, Application Engineering & Operations, Platform Engineering & Operations, and Integrated Service Management) play an integral part in the successful delivery and realisation of strategic initiatives, enabled through IT cloud capabilities and services.

This document describles the necessary forums that are required to determine how:
-    Digital products and services are being adopted and used via standardised frameworks and services.
-    Operations of capabilities and services are performing.

The Governance model will span across three accountability levels i.e. Strategy, Management and Operations — and will include board level decisions in Exec Committees through to day-to-day management decisions, which will in turn drive Operational delivery. An accountability level characterises the scope and intent of the activity and decision-making.

This cuts across all four IT Elements of a modern operating model.

---

## Infrastructure

-    Outlines type and frequency of internal reporting and communications
-    Defines scorecards, measures, and metrics to track performance
