<p>The next-generation operating model is made up of agile teams.</p>

<p>A Tribe can be visualized as an incubator for mini start-ups or major product development. The size of a Tribe is typically not more than 100 people. Example: Loans &amp; Deposit Services, Mortgage Services, Data Services could be valid tribes in a banking enterprise.</p>

<p>A Chapter is a horizontal slice across Squads within a Tribe. They have similar skills, work within the same general competency area, and within the same Tribe. A Guild is an enterprise-level Chapter. Example: Mobile Development, Service Management &amp; Operational Testing.</p>

<p>Squads, as autonomous service product development unit. Example: Account balance checking, Mortgage application process &amp; Data Warehouse in the context mentioned above.</p>

<p>This structure is applied across all areas of the organisation:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Tribes within Application Engineering &amp; Operations are organised around value streams or lines of business, with individual squads for individual services/products within them</li>
  <li>Tribes within Platform Engineering &amp; Operations are organised around major platform areas (i.e. tooling, security etc) , with individual squads for platform product sets (i.e. automation tooling) or individual services (i.e. Terraform)</li>
  <li>Guilds are managed and co-ordinated out of the Centre of Excellence and Integrated Service Management for various disciplines and communities of practice. They also have their own squads for developing their own products (i.e. Learning Management Platform, ITSM Tooling) and artefacts (i.e. architecture patterns, process definition)</li>
</ol>

<p>Application and Platform Squads may also form an integrated service tribe:</p>

<p><strong>Service Tribe</strong></p>

<p>Integrated Services Delivery Leader for an Service is the Tribe leader for that Service, cutting across the various Application and Platform squads that support that application.</p>

<p><strong>Application Squad</strong></p>

<p>Manages the end to end lifecycle of the Application.</p>

<p><strong>Platform Squad</strong></p>

<p>Manages the end to end lifecycle of the Platform.</p>

<p>Squad leader (or designate) of the Platform squad participates in the sprint planning of the applications they support; and translate platform related backlog items to the Platform squad backlog.</p>

<p>Designated resources in the Platform squad provide coverage for each Application that the Platform supports.</p>

<p>Platform developers in the Platform squad own creation of patterns needed for the application they are assigned to.</p>

<p>Platform SREs in the Platform squad work with the Application SREs to support end to end service reliability for the application they are assigned to.</p>
