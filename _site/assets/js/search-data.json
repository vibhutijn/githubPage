SRE is an engineering approach to deliberately introduce reliability into site operations. Fundamentally, it’s what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations function. SRE fundamentally changes the approach to systems management. It recognizes that throwing bodies at the problem is not a long term approach. Introducing ever and more complex layers of management does not yield a winning strategy. SRE and Application Development . SRE is an important discipline for application development in the current and future. It has evolved into a product development paradigm - an ongoing process of incrementally delivering new capabilities, continuous focus in required on maintaining and improving the resilience of the application.

    "content": "The guiding principles set the direction and guardrails for operating model transformation. A strong principle is supported by a clear rationale and associated implications. | Target Operating Model Principles | . | | . A Guiding Principle is a high level statement of intent or purpose intended to guide and govern the design &amp; operation of the operating model. The Rationale highlights the business benefits of adopting the principle. These are directly related to the mission statements. Implications are tasks that must happen in order to successfully implement the principle to realise the associated benefits. Here is a set of principles that are emerging in transformative enterprises: . | Business Oriented - In everything we do, have what we are trying to achieve as a business and what delivers value at heart. | Innovation - Constantly innovate in the products we create, the way we work, looking for inspiration in how we can transform our business by embracing the latest technology. | Agile culture - Create an agile culture where everyone is looking to deliver value through every action we take and making that available to others. | Developer First - Put the developer experience at the forefront of what we do and enable them to create business value and digital products that delight our customers. | Self-Service - Create products and platforms that can be easy accessed, understood and consumed, in a self-service way wherever possible. | Sharing - Share for the benefit of your colleagues, teams and the enterprise through assets, practices, experiences, skills and support. | . Principles will have an impact on the design and elaboration across a range of operating model dimensions, such as the 2nd example above i.e. Innovation. | Principle . | Constantly innovate in the products we create, the way we work, looking for inspiration in how we can transform our business by embracing the latest technology. | . | Rationale . | Our industry is underthreat from new start-up market entrants and therefore we need to make sure we innovate what we do to ensure we are constantly providing the best customer experience. | We need to transform the way we think and work as an organistion to ensure we are always improving what we do to be more effective and efficient, focusing on what adds value. | . | Implications . | Ways of Working: Provide Design Thinking and User Journey training to everyone in the organisation | Workforce Model: Allow headroom to our colleague to tackle ‘pet projects’ | Financial Model: Provide funding for ‘sandpitting’ of new technology to every employee | Processes: Create a mechanism to showcase potential initiatives to receive innovation funding | Leadership &amp; Culture: Develop a culture where people are encouraged to think differently and beyond the everyday | Partnering &amp; Sourcing: Establish a regular forum for our partners to showcase their latest thinking and technology | Financial Model: Provide funding for colleauges to attend conferences and technology showcases | Governance: Develop and innovation forum as part of our governance structure | Locations &amp; Facilities: Create innovation spaces where people can collaborate outside of normal teams | . | .

    "content": "How can I measure performance within my organisation in a way that proactively informs future decision-making while offering line of sight into accountability and decision ownership? . Metrics and KPIs need to change from retrospectively assessing performance to proactively driving action. Historically, performance metrics and KPIs were static measures that looked backward to assess progress and lacked traceability to an organisation’s strategic objectives. | Metrics | . | | . However, performance metrics must evolve to meet the demands of today’s modern IT estate. Instead of measuring past activity, metrics should be designed and implemented in a way that helps drive the organisation’s overall objectives and appropriate action, where possible, in a pre-emptive or predictive fashion. To do so, leading practice suggests organisations should use the industry recognised OKR (Objective &amp; Key Results) approach for measuring and improving performance. OKR . OKR is an Effective Methodology for Measuring Performance, OKR, known as Objective and Key Results, is a methodology is a system for setting, cascading and communicating goals throughout your organization. OKRs bring focus because they make it easy for companies, departments, and teams to recognize what the current priorities are, and to align them to employees personal objectives. Benefits of an OKR: . | Focus: OKR creates clarity and focus. Everyone has fewer defined objectives, which forces prioritisation at all levels. | Fast paced: OKRs are short term goals—typically 3 months in length. This gives employees more chances to assess and improve work. | Better results: using short term goals creates a culture where problems are solved quickly and where every contribution matters. This results in better and more consistent results | . An OKR consists of two things: . Objective - memorable qualitative description of what you want to achieve. Objectives should be short, inspirational and engaging. Objectives should motivate and challenge the team. Key Results - set of metrics that measure progress towards objective. They should not be a task. Each objective has 2-5 key results. For example, Objective #1: We will improve release velocity of the sprint Q3-2019 for version X.Y of product B as measured by …. Key Results: - Reduce bugs found during development process by 20% - Improve Unit testing coverage from 50% to 70% - increase sprint capacity from 85 item (Sprint Planning ) to 100 SP - Individual developer contributes to 20% more code review by end of every sprint . OKRs will vary across the organisation based on their priorities mapping reference OKRs to each CSOM component, such as: . | Center of Excellence Sample Objective: Drive adoption and usage of cloud services in consistent way; Sample Key Results: Enhanced skills on cloud technologies, Increased brand perception by customers | Platform Engineering &amp; Operations Sample Objective: Incubate new technology platforms; Sample Key Results: Faster time to provision infrastructure, Increased Automation with DevSecOps toolchain enabled | Integrated Service Management Sample Objective: Protect live service; Sample Key Results: Increase Process Efficiency, Proactively monitor services, Provide real-time reporting on service performance | Application Engineering &amp; Operations Sample Objective: Accelerate the development team speed; Sample Key Results: Reduced time to delivery, Change, release, incident and problem tightly coupled | . | OKR Pillars | . | | .
