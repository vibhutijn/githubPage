<h2 id="what-services-does-the-next-generation-it-organisation-offer">What services does the next generation IT organisation offer?</h2>
<p>The service portfolio outlines what is offered, developed and supported across the organisation using a common taxonomy, language and service definition. It covers all products and services across the organisation in a clear and transparent way.</p>

<p>Why is it important?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provides clarity on what products and services are offered, develop and managed within the organisation and by suppliers, with identified internal product owners</li>
  <li>Clearly defines the role between and application and platform engineering teams and establishes clear ownership</li>
  <li>Creates clear line of sight between business services and underlying technology simplifying supportability and operations</li>
  <li>Helps avoid duplication of functionality and accelerates development through patterns that are architected and built with the necessary security and compliance approval</li>
  <li>Make services more consumable by describing them in a common way, make costs transparent, presenting in a curated catalogue and automating access and provisioning where possible</li>
  <li>Helps manage the lifecycle of services driving investment decisions, architectural choices and service strategy</li>
</ul>

      <td>Compelling &amp; Competitive</td>
      <td>- The Service Offering must be compelling and competitive so that customers are willing to adopt it<br /> - The CCC must make sure the solution proposed as a Service Offering is cost effective and cost efficient.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Agile</td>
      <td>- The Service Definition process must follow a regular cadence of small, frequent and incremental iterations.<br /> - Prioritization efforts must take into consideration a positive feedback loop with customers and prospects.</td>
