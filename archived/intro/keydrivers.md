## Technology Trends

Technology evolutions drive innovation through Data, Integration, AI and Automation. 

### Distributed Cloud

Allows data centers to be located anywhere. This solves both technical issues like latency and also regulatory challenges like data sovereignty. It also offers the benefits of a public cloud service alongside the benefits of a private, local cloud.

### Data Fabrics

A core component of digitization is treating data as an asset. To be successful with digitization, businesses must use data management and governance techniques to free data from supporting IT components.

### Hyperautomation

Application of advanced technologies, including AI  and ML, to increasingly automate processes and augment humans. It refers to the sophistication of the automation (i.e., discover, analyze, design, automate, measure, monitor, reassess).

### Multiexperience

Immersive experiences that use AR, VR, mixed reality, multichannel human-machine interfaces and sensing technologies. The combination of these technologies can be used for a simple AR overlay or a fully immersive VR experience.

### Hybrid Integration

Unified, cloud agnostic integration platform that enables internal, external, edge, IoT, SaaS, market place and partner ecosystem integration using traditional and advanced integration technologies, e.g. event, messages, data transfer and streams.

### Edge & IoT

Information processing and content collection and delivery are placed closer to the sources of the information moving key applications and services closer to the people and devices that use them.. 

### Application Composition

Composable business functions, services and workflows from traditional applications, enabled by APIs, microservices and containers.

### Cognitive Augmentation

Enhances a humanâ€™s ability to think and make better decisions, for example, exploiting information and applications to enhance learning or new experiences. 

### Technology velocity and security

Technologies evolve rapidly, enabled by open source and cloud ecosystems and the need for increased security.
