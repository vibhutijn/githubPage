Everyone has fewer defined objectives, which forces prioritisation at all levels.<li>Fast paced: OKRs are short term goals—typically 3 months in length. This gives employees more chances to assess and improve work.<li>Better results: using short term goals creates a culture where problems are solved quickly and where every contribution matters. This results in better and more consistent results</ul><p>An OKR consists of two things:</p><p><strong>Objective</strong> - memorable qualitative description of what you want to achieve. Objectives should be short, inspirational and engaging. Objectives should motivate and challenge the team.</p><p><strong>Key Results</strong> - set of metrics that measure progress towards objective.
