## IBM's Approach

We offer a unique way of engaging through co-creation, joint squads, and the [IBM Garage Method for Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method){:target="_blank"} to deliver organizational change and a new culture of speed and velocity that’s sustainable for the digital future.

-    We think the best way to deliver co-creation to the clients is through joint squads
-    There should be SMEs from both IBM and from the client to ensure that skills are being transferred throughout the process
-    They’re working together in a very agile, very iterative way to prioritize what’s getting developed

There are three distinct ways of delivery build applications on cloud:
-    Envision: Quick engagement similar to a PoC that does high level architecture and defines the MVP
-    MVP: Actually building an MVP deployed to production – also contains elements of design and analyse
-    Scale:  Full engagement with multiple teams
