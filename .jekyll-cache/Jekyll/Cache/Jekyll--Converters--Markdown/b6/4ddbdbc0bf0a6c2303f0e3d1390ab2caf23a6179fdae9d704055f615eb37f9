<ul>
  <li>APIfication offers functionality and data as a service for other systems to use. It opens up new ways composing and exposing existing functionality.</li>
  <li>
    <p>An API hides the actual implementation and reveals only the simplified interactive model to the user.</p>
  </li>
  <li>APIFication can be done in a <em>proactive</em> or <em>reactive</em> fashion:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proactive</strong>: This includes defining the API interface first, based on forecasted need of the end consumer and then implementing it.</li>
      <li><strong>Reactive</strong>: This includes upfront implementation followed by a continuous definition of new interfaces on top of this implementation, based on the emerging needs of end consumer and then implementing it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Benefits of APIFication</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cost reduction</strong>: APIs promote and increase  service reuse. They provide a usage-based evolutionary development platform.</li>
      <li><strong>Increased agility</strong>: APIs offer integration with any technology stack, so they enable greater productivity for developers.</li>
      <li><strong>Increase innovation</strong>: By enabling others to build applications that integrate with their captive data and processes, companies see new applications that use their services in new contexts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
