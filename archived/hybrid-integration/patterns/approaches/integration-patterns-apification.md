- APIfication offers functionality and data as a service for other systems to use. It opens up new ways composing and exposing existing functionality.
- An API hides the actual implementation and reveals only the simplified interactive model to the user.

- APIFication can be done in a _proactive_ or _reactive_ fashion:
	- **Proactive**: This includes defining the API interface first, based on forecasted need of the end consumer and then implementing it.
	- **Reactive**: This includes upfront implementation followed by a continuous definition of new interfaces on top of this implementation, based on the emerging needs of end consumer and then implementing it.

- **Benefits of APIFication**:
	-   **Cost reduction**: APIs promote and increase  service reuse. They provide a usage-based evolutionary development platform.
	-   **Increased agility**: APIs offer integration with any technology stack, so they enable greater productivity for developers.
	-   **Increase innovation**: By enabling others to build applications that integrate with their captive data and processes, companies see new applications that use their services in new contexts.
