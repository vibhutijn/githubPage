<h2 id="ibms-approach">IBMâ€™s Approach</h2>

<p>We offer a unique way of engaging through co-creation, joint squads, and the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/garage/method" target="_blank">IBM Garage Method for Cloud</a> to deliver organizational change and a new culture of speed and velocity thatâ€™s sustainable for the digital future.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We think the best way to deliver co-creation to the clients is through joint squads</li>
  <li>There should be SMEs from both IBM and from the client to ensure that skills are being transferred throughout the process</li>
  <li>Theyâ€™re working together in a very agile, very iterative way to prioritize whatâ€™s getting developed</li>
</ul>

<p>There are three distinct ways of delivery build applications on cloud:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Envision: Quick engagement similar to a PoC that does high level architecture and defines the MVP</li>
  <li>MVP: Actually building an MVP deployed to production â€“ also contains elements of design and analyse</li>
  <li>Scale:  Full engagement with multiple teams</li>
</ul>
