# Target Operating Model

<br>

How you operate contributes more to the ability to innovate and being agile for an enterprise than any technology you can adopt as an enterprise. Operating Models for Future Application Development are about locking in the value of your investments in cloud and exploiting them for growth. Cloud is more than a set of technologies, therefore successfully adopting and operating multicloud requires operating model transformation:
-    Competitive disruption is driving new and changed business models enabled by technology that IT is asked to integrate, secure, and operate.
-    IT’s mission has been redefined to become a digital integrator across multiple business and IT platforms - a mission that requires a multicloud operating model.
-    Cloud technology cannot be separated from the organisational, cultural, and process transformation needed to use those technologies to drive desired business outcomes.

# 1. Overview

## A Design Thinking, Persona-driven Approach to Operating Model

To capture the value of these investments, enterprises need to change how they operate with clients, employees, partners, and regulatory authorities to provide digital products in a safe, sustainable, consistent, quality and profitable fashion. Our Cloud Strategy Operating model examines how to look at the changes you will need to make in organizing for and executing new work to deliver Digital Products and Services in a much changed operating environment. Each operating model dimension must be aligned with multicloud. A multicloud target operating model is: 
-    Powered by cloud platforms that are full-stack operated with clear governance and a powerful IT ecosystem
-    Supported by skilled people, collaborative enterprise culture, and automated processes.

# 2. What Do We Want To Be And What Do We Want To Achieve?


| **Target Operating Model Vision** |
| :-: |
| ![TOM Vision](../resources/tom-vision.png) |

Defining the vision for your organization, the services it will provide and the capabilities needed to deliver these, shaping how all other dimensions of the operating model need to be designed and the priority in which they need to be addressed. Defining from the outset a clear vision, mission & set of principles is critical as it sets the direction, tone and shape of all other operating dimensions.

## Constructing a Vision, Mission and Principles 

| **Target Operating Model Vision** |
| :-: |
| ![TOM Vision](../resources/tom-vision-pyramid.png) |

The two top layers of the detail are the ways in which vision and mission statements align to clients overarching strategy. **Vision** describes what we aspire to achieve e.g. Creating the very best digital products, enabled by flexible platforms and the best talent. **Mission** describles what we do and who we do it for.

These mission statements are subsequently met through key **transformation levers** which describe how the vision and mission be achieved.

The foundational layer introduces the key **principles** that guide the direction of transformation and underpin the way in which digital products are created and cloud is adopted within IT and adopted across the enterprise.


## Guiding Principles

The guiding principles set the direction and guardrails for operating model transformation. A strong principle is supported by a clear rationale and associated implications. 

| **Target Operating Model Principles** |
| :-: |
| ![TOM Principles](../resources/tom-principles.png) |

A Guiding Principle is a high level statement of intent or purpose intended to guide and govern the design & operation of the operating model. The Rationale highlights the business benefits of adopting the principle. These are directly related to the mission statements. Implications are tasks that must happen in order to successfully implement the principle to realise the associated benefits.

Here is a set of principles that are emerging in transformative enterprises:

1. **Business Oriented** - In everything we do, have what we are trying to achieve as a business and what delivers value at heart.
2. **Innovation** - Constantly innovate in the products we create, the way we work, looking for inspiration in how we can transform our business by embracing the latest technology.
3. **Agile culture** - Create an agile culture where everyone is looking to deliver value through every action we take and making that available to others.
4. **Developer First** - Put the developer experience at the forefront of what we do and enable them to create business value and digital products that delight our customers.
5. **Self-Service** - Create products and platforms that can be easy accessed, understood and consumed, in a self-service way wherever possible.
6. **Sharing** - Share for the benefit of your colleagues, teams and the enterprise through assets, practices, experiences, skills and support.

Principles will have an impact on the design and elaboration across a range of operating model dimensions, such as the 2nd example above i.e. Innovation.

* **Principle**
    - Constantly innovate in the products we create, the way we work, looking for inspiration in how we can transform our business by embracing the latest technology.
* **Rationale**
    -    Our industry is underthreat from new start-up market entrants and therefore we need to make sure we innovate what we do to ensure we are constantly providing the best customer experience.
    -    We need to transform the way we think and work as an organistion to ensure we are always improving what we do to be more effective and efficient, focusing on what adds value.
* **Implications**
    -    **Ways of Working**: Provide Design Thinking and User Journey training to everyone in the organisation
    -    **Workforce Model**: Allow headroom to our colleague to tackle ‘pet projects’
    -    **Financial Model**: Provide funding for ‘sandpitting’ of new technology to every employee
    -    **Processes**: Create a mechanism to showcase potential initiatives to receive innovation funding
    -    **Leadership & Culture**: Develop a culture where people are encouraged to think differently and beyond the everyday
    -    **Partnering & Sourcing**: Establish a regular forum for our partners to showcase their latest thinking and technology
    -    **Financial Model**: Provide funding for colleauges to attend conferences and technology showcases
    -    **Governance**: Develop and innovation forum as part of our governance structure 
    -    **Locations & Facilities**: Create innovation spaces where people can collaborate outside of normal teams


## How Vision, Mission & Goals effect the organizations in the enterprise

Over the course of the operating model transformation, each area of the organisation may elaborate their own set of principles in-line with the overall vision & mission.

# 3. Capabilities Required & Transition

<br>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><i>We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.</i></h2> <h3 style="text-align: right"><i>- Alan Turing</i></h3>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><i>No one is less ready for tomorrow than the person who holds the most rigid beliefs about what tomorrow will contain.</i></h2> <h3 style="text-align: right"><i>– Wacker, Taylor & Means</i></h3>


## What Capabilities Are Required to Deliver Digital Products & Pervices and Platform Services?

A broad range of capabilities are required to ideate, develop, support and control digital products and services throughout their lifecycle. 
-    **Engagement & Demand**: the capabilities needed to translate business strategy, needs and requests into products and platforms and ensure the right skills are available across the organisation.
-    **Product Lifecycle Management**: the capabilities needed to architect, develop and release both application and platform/technology products and services.
-    **Fulfillment & Provisioning**: the capabilities required to make products and services easily consumable and rapidly available for use when needed.
-    **Service Operations**: the capabilities required to support and operate products and services and ensure they are performant, resilient and meet business and user service levels.
-    **Governance & Control**: the capabilities required to support and operate products and services, and ensure they are performant, resilient and meet business and user service levels. 

Many of these capabilities cut across the organisation, but have a ‘centre of gravity’ of where the direction and approach for these is set. 
-    Many of these capabilities will be required across various areas of the organisation and will play a role in developing and supporting digital products in an effective, flexible and agile way.
-    However, there is typically a ‘centre of gravity’ within the organization that helps set the direction, standards and process for how that should be done across the organisation.
-    Where this ‘centre of gravity’ resides can vary depending on the maturity of the organisation and the level of autonomy in which parts of the organisation are given.

| **Capabilities** |

| ![Capabilities](../resources/capabilities.png) |


## Capability Evolution

The key question to ask is how these capabilities are changing for leading digital, platform and cloud enabled organisations? Some capabilities are reinventing themselves and some new capabilities are found to be necessary for optimization that is happening in the operating model of digital enterprises.

## How Do We Transition?

Assessing the maturity of these capabilities helps determine the areas for focus of operating model change and sets a baseline for measuring improvement. Undertaking a maturity assessment across these capabilities provides a number of benefits to defining the future operating model transformation
-    Bring visibility to current practices adoption
-    Identifying and prioritise gaps in existing capabilities
-    Expose pain points
-    Provide a future view of ambitions and goals with to help focus capability transformation
-    Structure the transformation priorities
-    Target quick wins and early proof points 

Additionally, this maturity assessment case act as a ‘yard stick’ to measure progress of the operating model transformation, alongside other KPIs that help support the measurement of each capability.

# 4. Services Portfolio

## What Services Does The Next Generation IT Organisation Offer?

The service portfolio outlines what is offered, developed and supported across the organisation using a common taxonomy, language and service definition. It covers all products and services across the organisation in a clear and transparent way.

Why is it important?
-    Provides clarity on what products and services are offered, develop and managed within the organisation and by suppliers, with identified internal product owners
-    Clearly defines the role between and application and platform engineering teams and establishes clear ownership
-    Creates clear line of sight between business services and underlying technology simplifying supportability and operations
-    Helps avoid duplication of functionality and accelerates development through patterns that are architected and built with the necessary security and compliance approval
-    Make services more consumable by describing them in a common way, make costs transparent, presenting in a curated catalogue and automating access and provisioning where possible
-    Helps manage the lifecycle of services driving investment decisions, architectural choices and service strategy

## Key Principles for Establishing Service Porfolios

| Principle                   | Description       |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Single & Hybrid Offering    | - The same offering must be delivered everywhere.<BR>- Leverage capabilities from Private and Public Cloud Providers and facilitate Exit Strategies.                  |
| Technology Agnostic         | - Focus on the abstraction and the interface defined by the service and the value which gets delivered rather than particular implementations that might be supporting it.                                                                              |
| Standardized & Prescriptive | - Consumer applications and services rely on the set of standardized set of Cloud Platform Services that have been published for each customer.<BR>- Each service might require a number of other mandatory service components (either by policy or as part of a bundle) in order to meet other key objectives and requirements.                |
| Managed & Platform-centric  | - As opposed to Workload centric offering, a Platform-centric offering provides Cloud Services that presents building blocks that can be used by consumer applications and services.<BR>- A managed Cloud Service Portfolio must ensure and deliver:<BR> - Value that contributes to fulfill the vision and the strategy<BR> - Enterprise grade SLAs. |
| Differentiated              | - A Single, Managed, Secure and Hybrid Multicloud offering presents a distinctive value chain that goes way beyond the one obtained by just doing a pass-through of technology proposals from different CSPs.                                           |
| Compelling & Competitive    | - The Service Offering must be compelling and competitive so that customers are willing to adopt it<BR> - The CCC must make sure the solution proposed as a Service Offering is cost effective and cost efficient.                                          |
| Agile                       | - The Service Definition process must follow a regular cadence of small, frequent and incremental iterations.<BR> - Prioritization efforts must take into consideration a positive feedback loop with customers and prospects.|

# 6. Manage and Control without Inhibiting Agility & Flexibility


## Overview

The modern Cloud Strategy Operating Model Governance model ensures that all four of its IT elements (i.e. Cloud Centre of Excellence, Application Engineering & Operations, Platform Engineering & Operations, and Integrated Service Management) play an integral part in the successful delivery and realisation of strategic initiatives, enabled through IT cloud capabilities and services. 

| **Governance** |
| :-: |
| ![](../resources/governance.png) |

This document describles the necessary forums that are required to determine how:
-    Digital products and services are being adopted and used via standardised frameworks and services.
-    Operations of capabilities and services are performing.

The Governance model will span across three accountability levels i.e. Strategy, Management and Operations — and will include board level decisions in Exec Committees through to day-to-day management decisions, which will in turn drive Operational delivery. An accountability level characterises the scope and intent of the activity and decision-making.

This cuts across all four IT Elements of a modern operating model.

| **Governance Pillars** |
| :-: |
| ![Governance](../resources/governance-pillars.png) |

Structured within a hierarchical model, each governing Board or Committee adds distinct value to the Enterprise:

| **Governance Structure** |
| :-: |
| ![Governance](../resources/govern-structure.png) |

But how does this work in practice?				

| **Governance Boards** |
| :-: |
| ![Boards](../resources/govern-boards.png) |

<br>

“Good” governance model is comprised of four main component:
- Structure
- Active Oversight Responsibilities
- Talent & Culture
- Infrastructure

## Structure

-    Outlines board and management committee structures, mandates, membership, and charters
-    Establishes design of governance framework
-    Delineates organizational structure, reporting lines, and relationships
-    Highlights roles and independence of control and support functions from business owners

## Active Oversight Responsibilities

-    Outlines the type of committees (board and management) and associated responsibilities
-    Specifies functional accountabilities for day-to-day management of business practices across the enterprise
-    Delineates board and management policies supporting delegation of authority  (decision rights) including reporting, escalation, and veto rights

## Talent & Culture

-    Aligns governance with operating and business principles
-    Articulates core beliefs and foundation for culture
-    Highlights characteristics of risk culture
-    Outlines leadership success, assessment, and development responsibilities
-    Aligns performance management, approach, measures and responsibilities to compensation and incentive plans

## Infrastructure

-    Establishes design and content of policy manuals and associated procedures
-    Outlines type and frequency of internal reporting and communications
-    Defines scorecards, measures, and metrics to track performance
-    Aligns technology and governance requirements

# 7. Financial Models


## Overview

Financial models for IT are evolving too, in line with the evolving digital enterprise and how they operate. Here are some of the key attributes of a suitable financial model to enable the enterprise to function effectively as an innovative organization and with agility:
1.    Asset light - Shifting from CAPEX to OPEX and dynamic accounting models
2.    IT Spend as a % of Customer Growth & Revenue Potential, ARPU
3.    Consumption driven IT economics
4.    Benefit & Value driven, not cost constraint decisions
5.    Committed investments to transform, start-up seed funding to innovate
6.    Optimise to Re-Invest


## Cloud Economic Considerations

An enterprise can generate value for itself from cloud by a combination of optimizing its IT infrastructure & operational cost and innovating its way to new revenue that it could not realize earlier.

| **Cloud Economics** |
| :-: |
| ![Cloud Economics](../resources/costing-cloud.png) |

1. Efficiently Utilize Cloud Resources
    - Proactively identify and eliminate unused resources
    - Identify and optimize idle resources
    - Right size resources for efficient cost and performance
2. Operational Optimization of Cloud Resources
    - Leverage dynamic auto scaling for cost optimized performance
    - Identify opportunities for movement to lower cost instances/families
    - Optimize and reduce operational costs of data resources
    - Balance performance and costs of cloud resources 
3. Financial Governance Mechanisms for Cost Management
    - Structural governance: Evaluate cost implications during design
    - Role governance: Determine the access, provisioning and budget authority for defined cloud roles
    - User governance: Create “menus” of available patterns for each role with cloud provisioning authority
    - Quality governance: Audit effectiveness and adherence to governance across all three levels
4. Pricing, Reserving and Discounting of Cloud Resources
    - Evaluate bulk pricing options for potential discounts prior to provisioning
    - Monitor use of cloud resources against purchased discounts
    - Utilize automated recommendations and alerting to identify opportunities for bulk purchases based on usage trends


## Value Levers

Different levels of value can be realized through layers of transformation:

| **Costing Layers** |
| :-: |
| ![Costing Layers](../resources/costing-layers.png) |

Value is driven through an exhaustive set of levers across 5 sources and needs to be supported by a business case. These are the 5 sources:

1. Business acceleration
    - Get 3.5X more benefit than public only
    - New insights and better client experiences
    - Faster time to market for all your apps
    - Innovation in a secure, consistent way 
2. Application modernization
    - Speed app release from months to weeks
    - Modernize 66% more apps
    - Consistent skills and agile dev ops 
    - Automation and less rework.
3. Infrastructure cost efficiency
    - Cut infrastructure costs by 4x with less maintenance
    - 95% incident reduction/higher resiliency 
    - Greater utilization
    - 10% infra cost savings
4. Regulatory and risk
    - Reduce compliance 
    - Spend by ~25%
    - Gain a single pane of control 
    - Consistent security/compliance policies 
    - Automation on a consistent stack
5. Strategic optionality
    - Realize a more agile, flexible architecture
    - Avoid vendor lock in
    - Match workloads to the right model 
    - Optimize cost by moving workloads

# 8. Digital Platforms & Supply Chains


This section tries to answer the following questions:
1.    How do I create a platform architecture to enable developers and business users to create business value?
2.    How do I best utilise and access an ecosystem of partners to add value to what we do?
3.    How has the recent pandemic changed traditional location-based working?


## Digital Platforms

Leading digital organisations are creating scalable, flexible and multi-level platforms that can be easily consumed by developers, business users and partners:

1. Business Platforms - Developing business platforms and services that can be re-used within the rest of the organisation (both business users and development teams) and with partners and B2B customers
2. Technology Platforms - Creating platforms on-top of cloud services that embed automation, controls and security that are easily consumable by developers ‘as code’ or via a self-service portal via a single pane of glass

| **Digital Platforms** |
| :-: |
| ![Digital Platforms](../resources/digital-platforms.png) |

The key drivers for such platforms are:
-    Engineered with open interfaces, 'standard' based and easy to connect to
-    Are aligned and pre-built to architectural, service, compliance and security standards
-    Removes a level of operations that needs to be performed by developers so they can focus on adding value and creating digital products
-    Adds value on-top of ‘out-of-the-box’ cloud and technology services 
-    Provides a set of stable core components, but which can support variety and evolution
-    Easily extensible, enabling scalability, not just on demand but based on strategy 
-    Encourages and facilitates innovation and novel usage
-    Opens up a business capability to be accessed by partners and customers
-    Allows the rest of the organisation and partners to add value and capture value through the interfaces

Business platforms are built upon a foundation of technology platforms, connected in an open and transparent way
-    Each platform provides a range of services that can be easily publish and consumed to construct digital products and services
-    These are surfaced either via APIs, CLI, self-service catalogues or through other user interfaces and visualisation engines (i.e. codeless BPM)
-    These can be combined together via open API and connectors
-    Each platform service should also provide APIs to monitor and operate services to provide visibility of availability and performance

| **Digital Platform Functions** |
| :-: |
| ![Digital Platform Functions](../resources/digital-platforms-functions.png) |


## Partnering & Sourcing

An effective IT Supply Chain improves and organisation flexibility, cost effectiveness and ability to build capability.

**What is the IT Supply Chain?**

The process off managing interactions with cloud providers (platform vendors, SaaS providers, service vendors) formally by selecting them based on their ability to meet identified requirements and managing performance against the agreed upon commitments within the Service Catalogue. 

Some of the  key focus areas in this function include:
-    Migrating to as-a-service commercial models for both technology infrastructure enabled by cloud computing and a flexible workforce that delivers outcome-driven engagements
-    Adopting a more liquid workforce as they try to bridge the skill gaps resulting from rapid changes in technology
-    Implement the right mix of local and global focus given the flexibility on cloud, new ways of working and need for shorter delivery cycles with high business involvement

**What benefits does it bring?**

| **Benefits from IT Supply Chain** |
| :-: |
| ![Benefits from IT Supply Chain](../resources/it-supply-benefits.png) |


### Considerations Design when designing your IT Supply Chain

1. Collaborative Sourcing Relationships - Shift away from focus on deliverables and service levels. Focus on a sourcing philosophy to embrace a partnership approach that can result in collaborative processes, skill development
2. Managed Capacity - As enterprises continuously evolve their strategies and roadmap, they would need to pull in capabilities and services on Demand
3. Open collaboration tooling - The new ways of working would need collaborative working practices across microsites. Supplier base model will need to adjust to match the DevOps Lifecycle
4. Service Brokerage and Orchestration - Provide a centralized catalog of internal and external cloud, business platform and Open APIs to fuel rapid innovation across the enterprise
5. Multisourcing Strategies - Unlike the conventional tower-based sourcing, Continuous Delivery in a cloud world require flexible sourcing strategies that allow multiple vendors collaborate with clearly defined roes
6. Opex Centric Consumption driven planning - The IT service framework now prices IT Services incrementally from the IT vendors to get accurate Operational Expense forecasting.  Consumption driven planning with Business Product Owners
7. Predictive Demand Planning - Use in-depth analysis and predictive forecasts to anticipate demand and initiate sourcing with sufficient lead times
8. Monitoring - Globally monitor and control all local / regional cloud service consumption for continuous platform optimisation. Drive usage analytics and chargebacks through automated single unified plane of control across cloud service providers
9. Mitigation - Managing Cloud Platform risks like Vendor-lock-in, latency, security, and availability as an integral part of the Sourcing Strategy 


## Dynamic Delivery

Pre-pandemic, delivery models were optimised with delivery across client site, nearshore and offshore delivery centres. To balance cost and value, enterprises had Co-located garages for experience and innovation complimented by distributed Agile practices.

With the pandemic, this was challenges as business continuity came to the fore. Enterprises had to deal with Dispersed teams & Individual silos, lack of certainty and change in priority of projects as well as security concerns - truly hindering innovation.

### Shift 1

Enterprises initially focussed on recovering from this situation and getting back into being a resilient organization. This shift was focused on Employee safety, making existing team members virtually equidistant, bringing certainty to Program delivery, increasing portability of tasks and restoring Innovation.

| **Resilient** |
| :-: |
| ![Resilient](../resources/resilient.png) |

This shifted focus on 100% Cloudified Delivery Methods by adopting to Virtual Garage models and updated Security procedures and getting their teams skilled in virtual execution.

### Shift 2

Having realized the longetivity of the situation and the ability to change, enterprises are evolving further to generate value in spite of the handicap. Delivery across sites and individuals are being optimized for skill and cost (hybrid and variable), Automation has been taken up a notch in the Cloudified Delivery Platforms.

| **New Normal** |
| :-: |
| ![New Normal](../resources/new-normal.png) |

The focus is now on building the ability in the enterprise to absorb shocks from external unforeseen events and be able to carry out any task, at any time, from anywhere. This, in turn, as offered an improved value and cost profile compared to pre-pandemic model,

# 9. Innovation & Agility in Delivery Approach

## New Ways of Working

To develop the future IT operating model, we recommend taking an agile, user centric approach. Take a persona lead approach, define user journeys to develop an operating model that is built for the people who will demand, consume and operate services. Elaborate and build out each operating model dimension in an agile and iterative way, informed by the user centric journeys and feedback on previous releases of the operating model.

| **Delivery Approach** |
| :-: |
| ![Delivery Approach](../resources/delivery-approach.png) |

Operating model dimensions are elaborated in an iterative way and based around key personas, the operating model is elaborated around those who will demand, consume and operate services.

# 10. Agile Metrics, Processes & Toolchain


## Performance - Measuring KPIs and SLAs

How can I measure performance within my organisation in a way that proactively informs future decision-making while offering line of sight into accountability and decision ownership?

Metrics and KPIs need to change from retrospectively assessing performance to proactively driving action. Historically, performance metrics and KPIs were static measures that looked backward to assess progress and lacked traceability to an organisation’s strategic objectives. 

| **Metrics** |
| :-: |
| ![Metrics](../resources/metrics.png) |

However, performance metrics must evolve to meet the demands of today’s modern IT estate. Instead of measuring past activity, metrics should be designed and implemented in a way that helps drive the organisation’s overall objectives and appropriate action, where possible, in a pre-emptive or predictive fashion. To do so, leading practice suggests organisations should use the industry recognised OKR (Objective & Key Results) approach for measuring and improving performance.

### OKR

OKR is an Effective Methodology for Measuring  Performance, OKR, known as Objective and Key Results, is a methodology is a system for setting, cascading and communicating goals throughout your organization. OKRs bring focus because they make it easy for companies, departments, and teams to recognize what the current priorities are, and to align them to employees personal objectives.

Benefits of an OKR:

-    Focus: OKR creates clarity and focus. Everyone has fewer defined objectives, which forces prioritisation at all levels.
-    Fast paced: OKRs are short term goals—typically 3 months in length. This gives employees more chances to assess and improve work.
-    Better results: using short term goals creates a culture where problems are solved quickly and where every contribution matters. This results in better and more consistent results

An OKR consists of two things:

**Objective** - memorable qualitative description of what you want to achieve. Objectives should be short, inspirational and engaging. Objectives should motivate and challenge the team.

**Key Results** - set of metrics that measure progress towards objective. They should not be a task. Each objective has 2-5 key results. 

    For example,   
    Objective #1: We will improve release velocity of the sprint Q3-2019 for version X.Y of product B as measured by ….

    Key Results:
    -    Reduce bugs found during development process by 20%
    -    Improve Unit testing coverage from 50% to 70%
    -    increase sprint capacity from 85 item (Sprint Planning ) to 100 SP
    -    Individual developer contributes to 20% more code review by end of every sprint

OKRs will vary across the organisation based on their priorities mapping reference OKRs to each CSOM component, such as: 

- Center of Excellence Sample Objective: Drive adoption and usage of cloud services in consistent way; Sample Key Results: Enhanced skills on cloud technologies, Increased brand perception by customers
- Platform Engineering & Operations Sample Objective: Incubate new technology platforms; Sample Key Results: Faster time to provision infrastructure, Increased Automation with DevSecOps toolchain enabled
- Integrated Service Management Sample Objective: Protect live service; Sample Key Results: Increase Process Efficiency, Proactively monitor services, Provide real-time reporting on service performance
- Application Engineering & Operations Sample Objective: Accelerate the development team speed; Sample Key Results: Reduced time to delivery, Change, release, incident and problem tightly coupled

| **OKR Pillars** |
| :-: |
| ![OKR Pillars](../resources/okr-pillars.png) |


## IT Processes

How do I adapt my processes to drive agility & speed, minimising friction without sacrificing control?

Key process underpin the capabilities required within the organisation -

**Engagement & Demand**: the capabilities needed to translate business strategy, needs and requests into products and platforms and ensure the right skills are available across the organisation

**Product Lifecycle Management**: the capabilities needed to architect, develop and release both application and platform/technology products and services

**Fulfillment & Provisioning**: the capabilities required to make products and services easily consumable and rapidly available for use when needed

**Service Operations**: the capabilities required to support and operate products and services and ensure they are performant, resilient and meet business and user service levels 

**Governance & Control**: the capabilities required to support and operate products and services and ensure they are performant, resilient and meet business and user service levels 

| **IT Processes** |
| :-: |
| ![IT Processes](../resources/processes.png) |


### Example Process: Engagement & Demand > Demand Management

Its the process of understanding the patterns of the business’ behaviors and relate those patterns to the impact on the supply of cloud services, synchronizing the consumption (demand) with the capacity (supply) of IT resources, as documented in the Service Catalogue.

**Objectives**
-    Minimize the mismatch between demand and supply
-    Minimize the mismatch between demand and the service catalog
-    Maximize reuse of the services in the service catalog
-    Identify the need for new or modified services and capabilities
-    Identify investment implications
-    Minimize the lead time to service the demand

**Outcomes**
-    Demand and capacity forecast model
-    Demand Servicing Lead time 
-    Ability to service both cloud and legacy assets
-    Predictability of budget estimates

**Activities**
- Define Demand Patterns
- Forecast Demand and Provision
- Manage Demand Provision Control
- Evaluate Demand Management Performance

**Cloud Adoption Considerations**
-    Multi-cloud service catalogs
-    Cloud consumption/demand policies
-    Trained BRMs to represent the CIO
-    Private cloud capacity constraints and AD resources
-    Demand for IT technology services to support requests from AD teams
-    Demand implications between cloud and legacy environments
-    Auto detect service usage patterns (e.g. seasonal spikes)
-    Continual refresh of 30-60-90 day demand forecasts

## IT Toolchain

Toolchain is a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks. In the landscape of fragmented tools and processes, it is important for the enterprise to integrate tools and practices from multiple vendors and open source projects.  

For an agile and innovative team, a IT tool chain is required which offers right tools for the job while keeping some standardization, allow for automating and redefining processes with AI and removes bottlenecks & delays in the production line, enables collaboration across eco-system & integration across team silos and embeds digital processes & methods and auto-checks for compliance & quality.
