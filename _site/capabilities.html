develop, support and control digital products and services throughout their lifecycle.</p><ul><li><strong>Engagement &amp; Demand</strong>: the capabilities needed to translate business strategy, needs and requests into products and platforms and ensure the right skills are available across the organisation.<li><strong>Product Lifecycle Management</strong>: the capabilities needed to architect, develop and release both application and platform/technology products and services.<li><strong>Fulfillment &amp; Provisioning</strong>: the capabilities required to make products and services easily consumable and rapidly available for use when needed.<li><strong>Service Operations</strong>: the capabilities required to support and operate products and services and ensure they are performant, resilient and meet business and user service levels.<li><strong>Governance &amp; Control</strong>: the capabilities required to support and operate products and services, and ensure they are performant, resilient and meet business and user service levels.</ul><p>Many of these capabilities cut across the organisation, but have a ‘centre of gravity’ of where the direction and approach for these is set.</p><ul><li>Many of these capabilities will be required across various areas of the organisation and will play a role in developing and supporting digital products in an effective, flexible and agile way.<li>However, there is typically a ‘centre of gravity’ within the organization that helps set the direction, standards and process for how that should be done across the organisation.<li>Where this ‘centre of gravity’ resides can vary depending on the maturity of the organisation and the level of autonomy in which parts of the organisation are given.</ul><div
