## What is TCC

- TCC patterns helps in managing distributed transactions for Systems using REST APIs. 
- It helps implementing distributed atomic transactions across REST services that aligns well with HTTP and REST principles.
- It provides a reservation process across multiple, independent REST services where failures before completion are guaranteed to have no effect and the system returns to its earlier consistent state.

## Roles in TCC

1. **TCC Participant services** are TCC-aware REST service providers.
1. **Coordinator service** is what we provide: a reusable service to manage the consistent confirmation (or cancellation) of a set of related participant service invocations (including recovery).
1. **Business process** manages business flow by making use of the TCC participants and coordinator service.

## TCC Stages

- Every REST service that participates in a distributed transaction needs to be TCC aware and is called as a TCC participant
- A TCC coordinator that manages the TCC flow on behalf of the client process.
- Client process invokes services on the TCC participants and TCC coordinator.

There are 2 stages in TCC:

1. **Try / Reserve**
	- The TCC coordinator makes an invocation via HTTP REST Call (mostly POST) on each TCC participant so that the participant can  _reserve_ a resource  on behalf of the client process. 
	- The reserved state is identified by a unique URI that can be used to confirm the reservation later and an optional expiration date/time after which the participant can autonomously cancel and move the resource back to the initial state.

2. **Confirm / Cancel** 
	- This state is reached when a reserved participant receives a confirmation message within the specified time frame.
    - If the business transaction fails, then the TCC coordinator makes an invocation via HTTP REST Call (mostly DELETE) on each participant so that the participant can  _unreserve_ the resource reserved in the previous stage.
    - If the business transaction succeeds, then the TCC coordinator makes an invocation via HTTP REST Call (mostly PUT) on each participant so that the participant can  _finalize the reservation_ on the resource reserved in the previous stage.

If there is any failures before stage #2, then everything will time out and cancel because of confirmations not being sent to TCC participants within stipulated time.

If there are failures during stage#2, then they are handled by the coordinator service, including recovery after crashes, network failures etc. This yields transactional guarantees for REST services.
