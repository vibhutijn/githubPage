<p>To develop the future IT operating model, we recommend taking an agile, user centric approach. Take a persona lead approach, define user journeys to develop an operating model that is built for the people who will demand, consume and operate services. Elaborate and build out each operating model dimension in an agile and iterative way, informed by the user centric journeys and feedback on previous releases of the operating model.</p>

<p>Operating model dimensions are elaborated in an iterative way and based around key personas, the operating model is elaborated around those who will demand, consume and operate services.</p>
