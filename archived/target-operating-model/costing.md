## Overview

Financial models for IT are evolving too, in line with the evolving digital enterprise and how they operate. Here are some of the key attributes of a suitable financial model to enable the enterprise to function effectively as an innovative organization and with agility:
1.    Asset light - Shifting from CAPEX to OPEX and dynamic accounting models
2.    IT Spend as a % of Customer Growth & Revenue Potential, ARPU
3.    Consumption driven IT economics
4.    Benefit & Value driven, not cost constraint decisions
5.    Committed investments to transform, start-up seed funding to innovate
6.    Optimise to Re-Invest

## Cloud Economic Considerations

An enterprise can generate value for itself from cloud by a combination of optimizing its IT infrastructure & operational cost and innovating its way to new revenue that it could not realize earlier.

1. Efficiently Utilize Cloud Resources
    - Proactively identify and eliminate unused resources
    - Identify and optimize idle resources
    - Right size resources for efficient cost and performance
2. Operational Optimization of Cloud Resources
    - Leverage dynamic auto scaling for cost optimized performance
    - Identify opportunities for movement to lower cost instances/families
    - Optimize and reduce operational costs of data resources
    - Balance performance and costs of cloud resources 
3. Financial Governance Mechanisms for Cost Management
    - Structural governance: Evaluate cost implications during design
    - Role governance: Determine the access, provisioning and budget authority for defined cloud roles
    - User governance: Create “menus” of available patterns for each role with cloud provisioning authority
    - Quality governance: Audit effectiveness and adherence to governance across all three levels
4. Pricing, Reserving and Discounting of Cloud Resources
    - Evaluate bulk pricing options for potential discounts prior to provisioning
    - Monitor use of cloud resources against purchased discounts
    - Utilize automated recommendations and alerting to identify opportunities for bulk purchases based on usage trends

## Value Levers

Different levels of value can be realized through layers of transformation:

| **Costing Layers** |

Value is driven through an exhaustive set of levers across 5 sources and needs to be supported by a business case. These are the 5 sources:

1. Business acceleration
    - Get 3.5X more benefit than public only
    - New insights and better client experiences
    - Faster time to market for all your apps
    - Innovation in a secure, consistent way 
2. Application modernization
    - Speed app release from months to weeks
    - Modernize 66% more apps
    - Consistent skills and agile dev ops 
    - Automation and less rework.
3. Infrastructure cost efficiency
    - Cut infrastructure costs by 4x with less maintenance
    - 95% incident reduction/higher resiliency 
    - Greater utilization
    - 10% infra cost savings
4. Regulatory and risk
    - Reduce compliance 
    - Spend by ~25%
    - Gain a single pane of control 
    - Consistent security/compliance policies 
    - Automation on a consistent stack
5. Strategic optionality
    - Realize a more agile, flexible architecture
    - Avoid vendor lock in
    - Match workloads to the right model 
    - Optimize cost by moving workloads
