## Background

Security and compliance have become top priorities in today’s volatile and uncertain business environment and must be integrated into software lifecycle to maintain velocity.

Enterprises are under pressure to implement DevSecOps to modernize and be agile, deliver faster, acquire industry best practices, but they face serious implementation challenges.

<br>

### Managing Tool Sprawl

Individual business units choose from a plethora of DevSecOps tools in the market, usually without an enterprise level view resulting in tool sprawl

<br>

### Centralized Management

Without a management layer and GitOps, pipeline definitions become too decentralized and creates pipeline sprawl. Centralized access control with pattern-based approach is necessary for every organization.

<br>

### Toolchain monitoring and management

Ongoing management of the toolchain instances and application delivery pipelines require significant efforts.

<br>

### Optimization with continuous feedback 

The need for continuous feedback and optimization to evaluate the impact of each release and gauge end user satisfaction is essential to deliver the right business outcomes.
