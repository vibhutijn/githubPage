# Low-Code No-Code


## What is Low-Code No-Code

Visual software deployment platform for creating business applications with a click or drag and drop of components and piecing them together. Key benefits of Low-Code No-Code development platforms are:

-    Quickly create and deploy applications
-    Improved business process agility and automation
-    Standard design and accessibility principles
-    Easy to build and test
-    A simple submission(data) transformed into end-end service
-    No complex deployments, hosting, integrations required
-    Business perspective development platforms
-    Frontend, backend, data, process flows, and architecture all embedded into the platform
-   Provides holistic view of the entire applications

- **Model components** should be immutable,any new changes should be new components, extensive testing is required, need support for flexible auth requirements.
- **Avoid vendor lock-in** by using open source-based components, no frequent updates to components, cultural changes and training needed.
- **Set appropriate security constraints** for B2E, B2C and B2B applications, customization is difficult, data compliance policies revisit needed.


## IBM Approach
Prebuilt assets to accelerate Low-Code Cloud Native Development.


### Client Scenario

Build an X-Press connect API marketplace for business and third party Partners with following features:
-    Partners to self-subscribe and map APIs on the platform
-    Automatic code generation, build and deploy to non-production environments
-    Certify and move to production in order to consume the APIs
