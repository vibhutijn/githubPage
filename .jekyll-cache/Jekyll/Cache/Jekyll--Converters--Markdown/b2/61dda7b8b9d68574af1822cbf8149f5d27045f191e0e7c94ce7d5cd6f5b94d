<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The modern Cloud Strategy Operating Model Governance model ensures that all four of its IT elements (i.e. Cloud Centre of Excellence, Application Engineering &amp; Operations, Platform Engineering &amp; Operations, and Integrated Service Management) play an integral part in the successful delivery and realisation of strategic initiatives, enabled through IT cloud capabilities and services.</p>

<p>This document describles the necessary forums that are required to determine how:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Digital products and services are being adopted and used via standardised frameworks and services.</li>
  <li>Operations of capabilities and services are performing.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Governance model will span across three accountability levels i.e. Strategy, Management and Operations ‚Äî and will include board level decisions in Exec Committees through to day-to-day management decisions, which will in turn drive Operational delivery. An accountability level characterises the scope and intent of the activity and decision-making.</p>

<p>This cuts across all four IT Elements of a modern operating model.</p>

<p>Structured within a hierarchical model, each governing Board or Committee adds distinct value to the Enterprise:</p>

<p>But how does this work in practice?</p>
